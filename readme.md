Welcome to CeeMyStuff!

        CeeMyStuff is a lightweight portfolio CMS (aka, 'Content Management System') using PHP (v.8) and SQLite (v.3). Developed as an alternative to bulkier systems such as WordPress, its aim is to be simple to use and install, while retaining the versatility to customize with a little HTML and CSS know-how. Although originally created with visual artists in mind, it has potential for many uses, including music, text works, and basic blogging.
        
        Building Blocks: Pages > Sections > Items

        CeeMyStuff has three website building blocks: Pages, Sections, and Items.

            > Pages - These are the webpages that make up your site. When you first install CeeMyStuff, it already has one Page: 'Home', which is where your visitors will land when they first direct to your site's web address. You can add as many other Pages as you see fit! More on Pages in the 'About Pages' section.
            > Sections - 'Sections' contain the content of your Pages. These can be standalone blocks of content, or they can contain 'Items'. By default, Pages only have one Section, but you can enable Pages to include as many Sections as you like. More on Sections in 'About Sections'.
            > Items - 'Items' are individual pieces or entries that you can add to a Section. If you are using CeeMyStuff to create a drawing portfolio site, your 'Items' may be your individual drawings; if you are creating an archive of your music, your 'Items' may be your songs; if you are creating a blog, your 'Items' may be your blog entries; etc.! More on 'Items' in 'About Items'. (coming soon)
